- From last experiment
	- have background population activity
	- can alternate between input and output
	- went back to conductance based synapses because they are much easier to understand

- 1. Add inhibitory synapses
	- need to add negative weight -> equal amount of inhibitory and execitatory -> no activity
	- Add ability to specify how much excitation I want -> I have activity, for now it makes sense, I have much more activity when both inputs are on

- 2. Add sdtp -> it will probably to crazy with activity, lets see -> actually no, but because I think each synapse make to little of a contribution,
	lets increase the amp values, yes it goes crazy

- 3. Add refract to neurons, lets see if something happens, not really, a gap in the activity of layer

- 4. Change the amp value -> it varies the degree of activity but in the end it ends up in epilepsy

- 5. I also change weight of the background population, should I?
	- lets keep the population connectivity fixed -> its better, but still much more activity when both are one, as expected

- From last time
	- everything happens as expected, if I increase the input activity the network output is stronger, background vs background with input
	- stdp doesn't really do anything special, it just makes the connections stronger

- 1. Merge everything

- 2. Continue with R-STDP
	- Not sure exactly how to implement it because right now the stdp works during the sample propagation, not after
	- and how do i know when to apply reward if I don't have the answer

- 3. What happens, similar to sdtp normal, lets remove some of the neurons


25.04.2025
- 1. Add accuracy callback
	- Needs a lot of work, added epoch in the simulator and in go

03.05.2025
- 1. made a lot of changes need to submit them
